API reference
=============

Overview
--------

This API reference documentation was automatically generated using the `Autodoc
<http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autodoc.htm>`_ Sphinx
extension.

Autodoc automatically processes the documentation of Mitsuba's Python bindings,
hence all C++ function and class signatures are documented through their Python
counterparts. Mitsuba's bindings mimic the C++ API as closely as possible,
hence this documentation should still prove valuable even for C++ developers.
