Inverse rendering tutorials
===========================

Mitsuba 3 can be used to solve inverse problems involving light using a
technique known as differentiable rendering. This enables us to estimate
physical attributes of a scene, e.g., reflectance, geometry, and lighting, from
images. The following tutorials will teach you how to use Mitsuba 3 in such
applications:
