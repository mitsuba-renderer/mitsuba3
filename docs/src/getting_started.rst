Getting Started
===============

Welcome to the Getting Started page of the Mitsuba 3 documentation. Before
getting our hands dirty, you will need to install the Mitsuba 3 and DrJit libraries
in our python environnement if it is not already done. Both libraries are distributed
on `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/mitsuba/>`_ and can easily be installed with
:monosp:`pip`:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip3 install mitsuba
