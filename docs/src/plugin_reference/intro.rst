Plugin reference
================

The following subsections describe the available 3 plugins, usually along with example
renderings and a description of what each parameter does. They are separated into subsections
covering textures, surface scattering models, etc.

The documentation of a plugin always starts with a table similar to the one below:

.. pluginparameters::

 * - soft_rays
   - |bool|
   - Try not to damage objects in the scene by shooting softer rays (Default: false)
 * - dark_matter
   - |float|
   - Controls the proportionate amount of dark matter present in the scene. (Default: 0.42)
 * - (Nested plugin)
   - :paramtype:`integrator`
   - A nested integrator which does the actual hard work

Suppose this hypothetical plugin is an integrator named ``amazing``. Then, based on this
description, it can be instantiated from an XML scene file using a custom configuration such as:

.. code-block:: xml

    <integrator type="amazing">
        <boolean name="softer_rays" value="true"/>
        <float name="dark_matter" value="0.44"/>
    </integrator>

In some cases, plugins also indicate that they accept nested plugins as input arguments. These can
either be *named* or *unnamed*. If the ``amazing`` integrator also accepted the following two parameters:

.. pluginparameters::


 * - (Nested plugin)
   - :paramtype:`integrator`
   - A nested integrator which does the actual hard work
 * - puppies
   - :paramtype:`texture`
   - This must be used to supply a cute picture of puppies

then it can be instantiated e.g. as follows:

.. code-block:: xml

    <integrator type="amazing">
        <boolean name="softer_rays" value="true"/>
        <float name="dark_matter" value="0.44"/>
        <!-- Nested unnamed integrator -->
        <integrator type="path"/>
        <!-- Nested texture named puppies -->
        <texture name="puppies" type="bitmap">
            <string name="filename" value="cute.jpg"/>
        </texture>
    </integrator>
