Phase functions
===============

This section contains a description of all implemented medium scattering models,
which are also known as phase functions. These are very similar in principle to
surface scattering models (or BSDFs), and essentially describe where light
travels after hitting a particle within the medium. Currently, only the most
commonly used models for smoke, fog, and other homogeneous media are implemented.
