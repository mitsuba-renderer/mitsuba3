Custom plugins in Python
========================

Mitsuba 3 provides a mechanism to implement custom plugins *directly in
Python*. To do so, simply extend a base class (e.g. `BSDF`, `Emitter`) and
override its class methods (e.g. ``sample()``, ``eval()``, ...). This leverages
the `trampoline feature
<https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/advanced/classes.html#overriding-virtual-functions-in-python>`_
of *pybind11*.

The new plugin can then be registered with the XML parser by calling one of
several ``register_<type>(name, constructor)`` functions, making it accessible
in the XML scene language like any other C++ plugin.

.. warning::

    Only ``cuda_*`` variants will produce reasonable performance
    when using such Python implementations of core system components (since
    they can be JIT-compiled along with other system components). We plan to
    extend this feature to further variant types in the future.

    Furthermore, only ``BSDF``, ``Emitter``, and ``Integrator`` plugins can
    currently be implemented in Python.

The remainder of this section discusses several examples.


BSDF example
------------

In this example, we will implement a simple diffuse BSDF in Python by extending
the :code:`BSDF` base class. The code is very similar to the diffuse BSDF
implemented in C++ (in :code:`src/bsdf/diffuse.cpp`).

The BSDF class need to implement the following 3 methods: :code:`sample`,
:code:`eval` and :code:`pdf`:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/04_diffuse_bsdf/diffuse_bsdf.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 14-64

After defining this new BSDF class, we have to register it as a plugin.
This allows Mitsuba to instantiate this new BSDF when loading a scene:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/04_diffuse_bsdf/diffuse_bsdf.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 66

The :code:`register_bsdf` function takes the name of our new plugin and a function to construct new
instances. After that, we can use our new BSDF in a XML scene file by specifying

.. code-block:: xml

    <bsdf type="mydiffusebsdf"/>

The scene can then rendered by calling the standard :code:`render` function:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/04_diffuse_bsdf/diffuse_bsdf.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 68-77

.. note:: The code for this example can be found in :code:`docs/examples/04_diffuse_bsdf/diffuse_bsdf.py`


Integrator example
------------------

In this example, we will implement custom direct illumination integrator using the same mechanism.
The resulting image will have realistic shadows and shading, but no global illumination.

The main rendering routing can be implemented in around 30 lines of code:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/03_direct_integrator/direct_integrator.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 22-55

The code is very similar to the direct illumination integrator implemented in C++
(in :code:`src/integrators/direct.cpp`).
The function takes the current scene, sampler and array of rays as arguments.
The :code:`active` argument specifies which lanes are active.

We first intersect the provided rays against the scene and evaluate the
radiance of directly visible emitters. Then, we explicitly sample positions on
emitters and evaluate their contributions. Additionally, we sample a ray
direction according to the BSDF and evaluate whether these rays also hit some
emitters. These different contributions are then combined using multiple
importance sampling to reduce variance.

This function will be invoked for an array of different rays, hence each ray
can then potentially hit a surface with a different BSDF. Therefore,
:code:`bsdf = si.bsdf(rays)` will be an array of different BSDF pointers. To
then call member functions of these different BSDFs, we invoke special dispatch
functions for vectorized method calls:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/03_direct_integrator/direct_integrator.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 38-39

This will ensure that the C++ or Python implementation of the right BSDF model
is invoked for each variant. Other than that, the code and used interfaces are
nearly identical to the C++ version. Please refer to the documentation of the
C++ types for details on the different functions and objects.

When implementing the depth integrator in the section on
:ref:`custom rendering pipelines <sec-rendering-scene-custom>`, considerable work was
necessary to correctly sample rays from the camera and splat samples into the film.
While this can be very useful for certain applications, it is also a bit tedious.
In many cases, we simply want to implement a custom integrator and not bother with how camera rays are exactly generated.
In this example, we will therefore use a more elegant mechanism, which allows to simply extend the :code:`SamplingIntegrator` base class.
This class is the base class of all Monte Carlo integrators, e.g. the path tracer.
By using this class to define our integrator, we can then rely on the existing machinery in Mitsuba to correctly sample camera rays and splat pixel values.

Since we already defined a function :code:`integrator_sample` with the right interface, defining a new integrator becomes very simple:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/03_direct_integrator/direct_integrator.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 58-70

This integrator not only returns the color, but also additionally renders out the depth of the scene.
When using this integrator, Mitsuba will output a multichannel EXR file with a separate depth channel.
The method :code:`aov_names` is used to name the different arbitrary output variables (AOVs).
The same mechanism could be used to output for example surface normals.
If no AOVs are needed, you can just return an empty list instead.

After defining this new integrator class, we have to register it as a plugin.
This allows Mitsuba to instantiate this new integrator when loading a scene:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/03_direct_integrator/direct_integrator.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 74

The :code:`register_integrator` function takes the name of our new plugin and a function to construct new instances.
After that, we can use our new integrator in a scene by specifying

.. code-block:: xml

    <integrator type="mydirectintegrator"/>

The scene is then rendered by calling the standard :code:`render` function:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/03_direct_integrator/direct_integrator.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 76-85

.. note:: The code for this example can be found in :code:`docs/examples/03_direct_integrator/direct_integrator.py`
