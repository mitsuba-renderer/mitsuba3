Choosing variants
=================

Mitsuba 3 is a retargetable rendering system that provides a set of different
system "*variants*" that change elementary aspects of simulation---they can for
instance replace the representation of color to support monochromatic, RGB,
spectral, or even polarized illumination. Similarly, the numerical
representation underlying the simulation can be exchanged to perform renderings
using a higher amount of precision, process many light paths at once on the GPU,
or it can be mathematically differentiated to to solve inverse problems. All
variants are automatically created from a single generic codebase. Each variant
is associated with an identifying name that is composed of several parts:

However, when installing Mitsuba on your system with ``pip``, only a subset of
those variants will be installed.

    - :monosp:`scalar_rgb`
    - :monosp:`scalar_spectral`
    - :monosp:`cuda_ad_rgb`
    - :monosp:`llvm_ad_rgb`

This is to avoid the burden of downloading massive binaries, but those should be
enough to get you started with Mitsuba 3. For advanced applications that require
another variant, you will need to compile it yourself. For this please refer to
the :ref:`documentation on compiling the system from source <sec-compiling>`.

Part 1: Computational backend
-----------------------------

The computational backend controls how basic arithmetic operations like
additions or multiplications are realized by the system. The following choices
are available:

- The ``scalar`` backend performs computation on the CPU using normal floating
  point arithmetic similar to older versions of Mitsuba. The renderer
  processes individual rays at a time. This mode is the
  easiest to understand and therefore preferred for fixing
  compilation errors and debugging the renderer.

- The ``cuda`` backend offloads computation to the GPU using `Dr.Jit's
  <https://github.com/mitsuba-renderer/drjit>`_ just-in-time (JIT) compiler
  that transforms computation into CUDA kernels. Using this backend, each
  operation typically operates on millions of inputs at the same time. Mitsuba
  then becomes what is known as a *wavefront path tracer* and delegates ray
  tracing on the GPU to NVIDIA's OptiX library. Note that this requires a
  relatively recent NVIDIA GPU: ideally *Turing* or newer. The older *Pascal*
  architecture is also supported but tends to be slower because it lacks ray
  tracing hardware acceleration.

- ``llvm``: Similar to the ``cuda`` backend, the computation required to render
  a scene is just-in-time compiled using ``Dr.Jit`` to parallel CPU kernels that
  process many rays at the same time. This uses the LLVM compiler framework,
  which is detected and loaded at runtime. If you don't have a NVIDIA GPU, this
  mode is a great alternative to the ``cuda`` backend.

An appealing aspect of the ``llvm`` and ``cuda`` modes, is that they expose
*vectorized* Python interfaces that operate on arbitrarily large set of inputs.
This means that millions of ray tracing operations or BSDF evaluations can be
performed with a single Python function call, enabling efficient prototyping
within Python or Jupyter notebooks without costly iteration over many elements.

Part 2: Automatic differentiation
---------------------------------

It is possible to add the ``_ad`` suffix to enable automatic differentiation for
both ``cuda`` and ``llvm`` modes. In which case the backend will furthermore
propagates derivative information through the simulation, which is a crucial
ingredient for solving *inverse problems* using rendering algorithms.

The following shows an example from :cite:`NimierDavidVicini2019Mitsuba2`.
Here, Mitsuba 3 is used to compute the height profile of a transparent glass
panel that refracts red, green, and blue light in such a way as to reproduce
a specified color image.

.. image:: ../../../resources/data/docs/images/autodiff/caustic.jpg
    :width: 100%
    :align: center

The main use case of the ``_ad`` backends is *differentiable
rendering*, which interprets the rendering algorithm as a function
:math:`f(\mathbf{x})` that converts an input :math:`\mathbf{x}` (the scene
description) into an output :math:`\mathbf{y}` (the rendering). This function
:math:`f` is then mathematically differentiated to obtain
:math:`\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{y}}{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{x}}`, providing a
first-order approximation of how a desired change in the output
:math:`\mathbf{y}` (the rendering) can be achieved by changing the inputs
:math:`\mathbf{x}` (the scene description). Together with a differentiable
*objective function* :math:`g(\mathbf{y})` that quantifies the suitability of
tentative scene parameters and a gradient-based optimization algorithm, a
differentiable renderer can be used to solve complex inverse problems
involving light.

The documentations provides several applied examples on :ref:`differentiable
and inverse rendering <sec-diff-rendering-tutos>`.

.. _sec-variants-colors:
Part 3: Color representation
----------------------------

The next part determines how Mitsuba represents color information. The
following choices are available:

- ``mono`` completely disables the concept of color, which is useful when
  simulating scenes that are inherently monochromatic (e.g. illumination due to
  a laser). This mode is great for writing testcases where color is simply not
  relevant. When an input scene provides color information, :monosp:`mono` mode
  automatically converts it to grayscale.

- ``rgb`` mode selects an RGB-based color representation. This is a reasonable
  default choice and matches the typical behavior of the previous generation of
  Mitsuba. On the flipside, RGB mode can be a poor approximation of how color
  works in the real world. Please click on the following for a longer
  explanation.

        .. container:: header

            **Issues involving RGB-based rendering (click to expand)**

        **Problematic aspects of RGB-based color representations:** A RGB
        rendering algorithm frequently performs two color-related operations:
        component-wise addition to combine different sources of light, and
        component-wise multiplication of RGB color vectors to model
        interreflection. While addition is fine, RGB multiplication turns out
        to be a nonsensical operation, that can give very different answers
        depending on the underlying RGB color space.

        Suppose we are rendering a scene in an sRGB color space, where a green
        light with radiance :math:`[0, 0, 1]` reflects from a very green
        surface with albedo :math:`[0, 0, 1]`. The component-wise
        multiplication :math:`[0, 0, 1] \otimes [0, 0, 1] = [0, 0, 1]` tells us
        that no light is absorbed by the surface. So good so far.

        Let's now switch to a larger color space named *Rec. 2020*. That same
        green color is no longer at the extreme of the color gamut but lies
        somewhere inside.

        .. image:: ../../../resources/data/docs/images/variants/rgb-mode-issue.svg
            :width: 100%
            :align: center

        For simplicity, let's suppose it has coordinates :math:`[0, 0,
        \frac{1}{2}]`. Now, the same calculation :math:`[0, 0,
        \frac{1}{2}]\otimes[0, 0, \frac{1}{2}]=[0, 0, \frac{1}{4}]` tells us
        that half of the light is absorbed by the surface, which illustrates
        the problem with RGB multiplication. The solution to this problem is to
        multiply colors in the spectral domain instead.


- Finally, ``spectral`` mode switches to a fully spectral color representation
  spanning the visible range :math:`(360\ldots 830 \mathrm{nm})`. The
  wavelength domain is simply treated as yet another dimension of the space of
  light paths over which the rendering algorithm must integrate.

  This improves accuracy especially in scenarios where measured spectral data
  is available. Consider for example the two Cornell box renderings below: on
  the left side, the spectral reflectance data of all materials is first
  converted to RGB and rendered using the ``scalar_rgb`` variant, producing a
  deceivingly colorful image. In contrast, the ``scalar_spectral`` variant that
  correctly accounts for the spectral characteristics, produces a more muted
  coloration.

  .. subfigure:: ../../../resources/data/docs/images/render/variants_cbox_spectral.jpg
     :caption: Spectral Mode
  .. subfigend::
     :label: fig-cbox-spectral

  Note that Mitsuba still generates RGB output images by default even when
  spectral mode is active. It is also important to note that many existing
  Mitsuba scenes only specify RGB color information. Spectral Mitsuba can still
  render such scenes -- in this case, it determines plausible smooth spectra
  corresponding to the specified RGB colors :cite:`Jakob2019Spectral`. We also
  recommend taking a look at the :ref:`Spectral film plugin<film-specfilm>`
  which is able to output spectral multichannel output images.

Part 4: Polarization
--------------------

If desired, Mitsuba 3 can keep track of the full polarization state of light.
Polarization refers to the property that light is an electromagnetic wave that
oscillates perpendicularly to the direction of travel. This oscillation can
take on infinitely many different shapes---the following images show examples
of *horizontal* and *elliptical* polarization.

.. image:: ../../../resources/data/docs/images/polarization/polarization_wave_variations.svg
    :width: 90%
    :align: center

Because humans do not perceive polarization, accounting for it is usually not
necessary to render realistic images.
However, polarization is easily observed using a variety of measurement devices
and cameras, and it tends to provide a wealth of information about the material
and shape of visible objects. For this reason, polarization is a powerful tool
for solving inverse problems, and this is one of the reasons why we chose to
support it in Mitsuba 3. Note that accounting for polarization comes at a
cost---roughly a 1.5-2X increase in rendering time.

Inside the light transport simulation, *Stokes vectors* are used to
parameterize the elliptical shape of the transverse oscillations, and *Mueller
matrices* are used to compute the effect of surface scattering on the
polarization :cite:`Collett1993PolarizedLight`. For more details regarding the
implementation of the polarized rendering modes, please refer to the
:ref:`developer_guide-polarization` section in the developer guide.


Part 5: Precision
-----------------

Mitsuba 3 normally relies on single precision (32 bit) arithmetic, but double
precision (64 bit) is optionally available adding the ``_double`` suffix to the
variant name. We find this particularly helpful for debugging: whether or not an
observed problem arises due to floating point imprecisions can normally be
determined after switching to double precision. Note that Embree and OptiX don't
support double precision, hence ray-tracing operations will run in reduced
(single) precision in those modes. The only way to use precision for everything
including ray tracing is to render on the CPU (``scalar`` or ``llvm``) and
disable Embree in CMake. Also note that double precision arithmetic runs with
greatly reduced throughput (1/64th of FP32) on recent NVIDIA GPUs.
