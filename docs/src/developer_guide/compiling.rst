Compiling the system
====================

Cloning the repository
----------------------

Compiling Mitsuba 3 from scratch requires recent versions of CMake (at least
**3.9.0**) and Python (at least **3.8**). Further platform-specific dependencies
and compilation instructions are provided below for each operating system. Some
additional steps are required for GPU-based backends that are described at the
end of this section.

Mitsuba depends on several external dependencies, and its repository directly
refers to specific versions of them using a Git feature called *submodules*.
Cloning Mitsuba's repository will recursively fetch these dependencies, which
are subsequently compiled using a single unified build system. This dramatically
reduces the number steps needed to set up the renderer compared to previous
versions of Mitsuba.

Most of Mitsuba's active development happens on the ``master`` Git branch. We
therefore recommend using the ``stable`` branch which points to the most recent
release.

For all of this to work out properly, you will have to specify the
``--recursive`` flag when cloning the repository:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone -b stable --recursive https://github.com/mitsuba-renderer/mitsuba3

If you already cloned the repository and forgot to specify this flag, it's
possible to fix the repository in retrospect using the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    git submodule update --init --recursive

**Staying up-to-date**

Unfortunately, pulling from the main repository won't automatically keep the
submodules in sync, which can lead to various problems. The following command
installs a git alias named ``pullall`` that automates these two steps.

.. code-block:: bash

    git config --global alias.pullall '!f(){ git pull "$@" && git submodule update --init --recursive; }; f'

Afterwards, simply write

.. code-block:: bash

    git pullall

to fetch the latest version of Mitsuba 3.

Configuring :monosp:`mitsuba.conf`
----------------------------------

Mitsuba 3 variants are specified in the file :monosp:`mitsuba.conf`. This file
can be found in the build directory and will be created when executing CMake the
first time.

Open :monosp:`mitsuba.conf` in your favorite text editor and scroll down to the
declaration of the enabled variants (around line 86):

.. code-block:: text

    "enabled": [
        "scalar_rgb", "scalar_spectral", "cuda_ad_rgb", "llvm_ad_rgb", "llvm_ad_spectral"
    ],

The default file specifies two scalar variants that you may wish to extend
according to your requirements and the explanations given above. Note that
``scalar_spectral`` can be removed, but ``scalar_rgb`` *must* currently be part
of the list as some core components of Mitsuba depend on it. In addition,
at least one ``ad``-enabled variant must also be compiled. If Mitsuba is
launched from the command line without any specific mode parameter, the first
variant of the list below will be used.

You may also wish to change the *Python default* variant that is executed if no
variant is explicitly specified (this must be one of the entries of the
``enabled`` list):

.. code-block:: text

    "python-default": "llvm_ad_rgb",

The remainder of this file lists the C++ types defining the available variants
and can safely be ignored.

TLDR: If you plan to use Mitsuba from Python, we recommend adding one of
``llvm_ad_rgb`` or ``llvm_ad_spectral`` for CPU rendering, or one of
``cuda_ad_rgb`` or ``cuda_ad_spectral`` for differentiable GPU rendering.

.. warning::

    Note that compilation time and compilation memory usage is roughly
    proportional to the number of enabled variants, hence including many of them
    (more than five) may not be advisable. Also note that the ``scalar_rgb`` 
    and *at least one AD variant* is mandatory.

.. warning::

    Mitsuba 3 also generates corresponding
    `Python stub files <https://typing.readthedocs.io/en/latest/spec/distributing.html#stub-files>`_
    during compilation. The process involves selecting one of the available variants
    to extract the relevant type information. However, these stub files have to
    be variant-agnostic and hence certain combinations of variants won't be allowed.
    For example, including just `scalar_rgb`, `scalar_spectral` and `llvm_ad_rgb`
    creates ambiguity as to which variant we should select to generate the Python stubs.
    In short, if a disallowed combination of variants is selected, a compilation 
    error will report what variant should be added to remove any ambiguity.

Linux
-----

The build process under Linux requires several external dependencies that are
easily installed using the system-provided package manager (e.g.,
:monosp:`apt-get` under Ubuntu).

Note that recent Linux distributions include two different compilers that can
both be used for C++ software development. `GCC <https://gcc.gnu.org>`_ is
typically the default, and `Clang <https://clang.llvm.org>`_ can be installed
optionally. During the development of this project, we encountered many issues
with GCC (mis-compilations, compiler errors, segmentation faults), and strongly
recommend that you use Clang instead.

To fetch all dependencies and Clang, enter the following commands on Ubuntu:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Install recent versions build tools, including Clang and libc++ (Clang's C++ library)
    sudo apt install clang-17 libc++-17-dev libc++abi-17-dev cmake ninja-build

    # Install libraries for image I/O
    sudo apt install libpng-dev libjpeg-dev

    # Install required Python packages
    sudo apt install libpython3-dev python3-distutils

Additional packages are required to run the included test suite or to generate
HTML documentation (see :ref:`Developer guide <sec-writing-documentation>`). If those are
interesting to you, also enter the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

    # For running tests
    sudo apt install python3-pytest python3-pytest-xdist python3-numpy

Next, ensure that two environment variables :monosp:`CC` and :monosp:`CXX` are
exported. You can either run these two commands manually before using CMake
or---even better---add them to your :monosp:`~/.bashrc` file. This ensures that
CMake will always use the correct compiler.

.. code-block:: bash

    export CC=clang-17 export CXX=clang++-17

If you installed another version of Clang, the version suffix of course has to
be adjusted. Now, compilation should be as simple as running the following from
inside the :monosp:`mitsuba3` root directory:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Create a directory where build products are stored
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -GNinja .. 
    ninja


**Tested versions**

The above procedure will likely work on many different flavors of Linux (with
slight adjustments for the package manager and package names). We have mainly
worked with software environments listed below, and our instructions should work
without modifications in those cases.

Windows
-------

On Windows, a recent version of `Visual Studio 2022
<https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/>`_ is required. Some tools such as git,
CMake, or Python might need to be installed manually. Mitsuba's build system
*requires* access to Python >= 3.8 even if you do not plan to use Mitsuba's
python interface.

From the root `mitsuba3` directory, the build can be configured with:

.. code-block:: bash

    # To be safe, explicitly ask for the 64 bit version of Visual Studio
    cmake -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 -B build


Afterwards, open the generated ``mitsuba.sln`` file in the build folder and
proceed building as usual from within Visual Studio. You will probably also
want to set the build mode to *Release* there.

It is also possible to directly build from the terminal running the following
command:

.. code-block:: bash

    cmake --build build --config Release


**Tested version**

* Windows 10
* Visual Studio 17 2022 (Community Edition)
* MSVC 19.41.34123.0
* cmake 3.28.1 (64bit)
* git 2.34.1 (64bit)
* Python 3.11.1 (64bit)


macOS
-----

On macOS, you will need to install Xcode, CMake, and `Ninja
<https://ninja-build.org/>`_. Additionally, running the Xcode command line tools
once might be necessary:

.. code-block:: bash

    xcode-select --install

Note that the default Python version installed with macOS is not compatible with
Mitsuba 3, and a more recent version (at least 3.8) needs to be installed (e.g.
via `Miniconda 3 <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_ or `Homebrew
<https://brew.sh/>`_).

Now, compilation should be as simple as running the following from inside the
`mitsuba3` root directory:

.. code-block:: bash

    mkdir build 
    cd build 
    cmake -GNinja .. 
    ninja


**Tested version**

* macOS Big Sur 11.5.2
* AppleClang 13.2.0.0.1.1638488800
* Xcode 12.0.5
* cmake 3.24.2
* Python 3.9.5


Running Mitsuba
---------------

Once Mitsuba is compiled, run the ``setpath.sh/.bat/.ps1`` script in your build
directory to configure environment variables (``PATH/PYTHONPATH``) that are
required to run Mitsuba.

.. code-block:: bash

    # On Linux / Mac OS
    source setpath.sh

    # On Windows (cmd)
    C:/.../mitsuba3/build/Release> setpath

    # On Windows (powershell)
    C:/.../mitsuba3/build/Release> .\setpath.ps1

Mitsuba can then be used to render scenes by typing

.. code-block:: bash

    mitsuba scene.xml

where ``scene.xml`` is a Mitsuba scene file. Alternatively,

.. code-block:: bash

    mitsuba -m scalar_spectral_polarized scene.xml

renders with a specific variant that was previously enabled in
:monosp:`mitsuba.conf`. Call ``mitsuba --help`` to print additional information
about the various possible command line options.


GPU variants
------------

Variants of Mitsuba that run on the GPU (e.g. :monosp:`cuda_rgb`,
:monosp:`cuda_ad_spectral`, etc.) will try to dynamically load the CUDA shared
libraries from your system. There is no need to manually install any specific
version of CUDA.

Make sure to have an up-to-date GPU driver if the framework fails to compile
the GPU variants of Mitsuba. The minimum requirement is currently v535.

By default, Mitsuba is also able to resolve the OptiX API itself, and therefore
does not rely on the ``optix.h`` header file. The ``MI_USE_OPTIX_HEADERS`` CMake
flag can be used to turn off this feature if a developer wants to experiment
with parts of the OptiX API not yet exposed to the framework.

Embree
------

By default, Mitsuba's ``scalar`` and ``llvm`` backends use Intel's Embree
library for ray tracing instead of the builtin kd-tree in Mitsuba 3. To change
this behavior, invoke CMake with the ``-DMI_ENABLE_EMBREE=0`` parameter
or use a visual CMake tool like ``cmake-gui`` or ``ccmake`` to flip the value of
this parameter. Embree tends to be faster but lacks some features such as
support for double precision ray intersection.
