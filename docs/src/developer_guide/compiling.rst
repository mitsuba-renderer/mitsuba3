Compiling the system
====================

Before continuing, please make sure that you have read and followed the
instructions on :ref:`cloning Mitsuba 3 and its dependencies <sec-cloning>` and
:ref:`choosing desired variants <sec-variants>`.

Compiling Mitsuba 3 from scratch requires recent versions of CMake (at least
**3.9.0**) and Python (at least **3.6**). Further platform-specific
dependencies and compilation instructions are provided below for each operating
system. Some additional steps are required for GPU-based backends that are
described at the end of this section.

Linux
-----

The build process under Linux requires several external dependencies that are
easily installed using the system-provided package manager (e.g.,
:monosp:`apt-get` under Ubuntu).

Note that recent Linux distributions include two different compilers that can
both be used for C++ software development. `GCC <https://gcc.gnu.org>`_ is
typically the default, and `Clang <https://clang.llvm.org>`_ can be installed
optionally. During the development of this project, we encountered many issues
with GCC (mis-compilations, compiler errors, segmentation faults), and strongly
recommend that you use Clang instead.

To fetch all dependencies and Clang, enter the following commands on Ubuntu:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Install recent versions build tools, including Clang and libc++ (Clang's C++ library)
    sudo apt install clang-9 libc++-9-dev libc++abi-9-dev cmake ninja-build

    # Install libraries for image I/O and the graphical user interface
    sudo apt install libz-dev libpng-dev libjpeg-dev libxrandr-dev libxinerama-dev libxcursor-dev

    # Install required Python packages
    sudo apt install python3-dev python3-distutils python3-setuptools

Additional packages are required to run the included test suite or to generate HTML
documentation (see :ref:`Developer guide <sec-devguide>`). If those are interesting to you, also
enter the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

    # For running tests
    sudo apt install python3-pytest python3-pytest-xdist python3-numpy

    # For generating the documentation
    sudo apt install python3-sphinx python3-guzzle-sphinx-theme python3-sphinxcontrib.bibtex

Next, ensure that two environment variables :monosp:`CC` and
:monosp:`CXX` are exported. You can either run these two commands manually
before using CMake or---even better---add them to your :monosp:`~/.bashrc`
file. This ensures that CMake will always use the correct compiler.

.. code-block:: bash

    export CC=clang-9
    export CXX=clang++-9

If you installed another version of Clang, the version suffix of course has to be adjusted.
Now, compilation should be as simple as running the following from inside the
:monosp:`mitsuba2` root directory:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Create a directory where build products are stored
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -GNinja ..
    ninja


Tested version
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The above procedure will likely work on many different flavors of Linux (with
slight adjustments for the package manager and package names). We have mainly
worked with software environment listed below, and our instructions should work
without modifications in that case.

* Ubuntu 19.10
* clang 9.0.0-2 (tags/RELEASE_900/final)
* cmake 3.13.4
* ninja 1.9.0
* python 3.7.5

Windows
-------

On Windows, a recent version of `Visual Studio 2019
<https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/>`_ is required. Some tools such as git,
CMake, or Python (e.g. via `Miniconda 3
<https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_) might need to be installed
manually. Mitsuba's build system *requires* access to Python >= 3.6 even if you
do not plan to use Mitsuba's python interface.

From the root `mitsuba2` directory, the build can be configured with:

.. code-block:: bash

    # To be safe, explicitly ask for the 64 bit version of Visual Studio
    cmake -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -A x64


Afterwards, open the generated ``mitsuba.sln`` file and proceed building as
usual from within Visual Studio. You will probably also want to set the build
mode to *Release* there.

Additional packages are required to run the included test suite or to generate HTML
documentation (see :ref:`Developer guide <sec-devguide>`). If those are interesting to you, also
enter the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install pytest numpy sphinx


Tested version
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Windows 10
* Visual Studio 2019 (Community Edition) Version 16.4.5
* cmake 3.16.4 (64bit)
* git 2.25.1 (64bit)
* Miniconda3 4.7.12.1 (64bit)


macOS
-----

On macOS, you will need to install Xcode, CMake, and `Ninja <https://ninja-build.org/>`_.
Additionally, running the Xcode command line tools once might be necessary:

.. code-block:: bash

    xcode-select --install

Note that the default Python version installed with macOS is not compatible with Mitsuba 3, and a more recent version (at least 3.6) needs to be installed (e.g. via `Miniconda 3 <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_ or `Homebrew <https://brew.sh/>`_).

Now, compilation should be as simple as running the following from inside the `mitsuba2` root directory:

.. code-block:: bash

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -GNinja ..
    ninja


Tested version
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* macOS Catalina 10.15.2
* Xcode 11.3.1
* cmake 3.16.4
* Python 3.7.3


Running Mitsuba
---------------

Once Mitsuba is compiled, run the ``setpath.sh/bat`` script to configure
environment variables (``PATH/LD_LIBRARY_PATH/PYTHONPATH``) that are required
to run Mitsuba.

.. code-block:: bash

    # On Linux / Mac OS
    source setpath.sh

    # On Windows
    C:/.../mitsuba2> setpath

Mitsuba can then be used to render scenes by typing

.. code-block:: bash

    mitsuba scene.xml

where ``scene.xml`` is a Mitsuba scene file. Alternatively,

.. code-block:: bash

    mitsuba -m scalar_spectral_polarized scene.xml

renders with a specific variant that was previously enabled in
:monosp:`mitsuba.conf`. Call ``mitsuba --help`` to print additional information
about the various possible command line options.


GPU variants
------------

Variants of Mitsuba that run on the GPU (e.g. :monosp:`cuda_rgb`,
:monosp:`cuda_autodiff_spectral`, etc.) additionally depend on the `NVIDIA CUDA
Toolkit <https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads>`_ and `NVIDIA OptiX
<https://developer.nvidia.com/designworks/optix/download>`_. CUDA needs to be installed
manually while OptiX 7 ships natively with the latest GPU driver. Make sure to have an
up-to-date GPU driver if the framework fails to compile the GPU variants of Mitsuba.

Tested versions of CUDA include 10.0, 10.1, and 10.2. Only OptiX 7 is supported at this moment.

.. warning::

    Neither GPU- nor differentiable rendering currently work on macOS, which is
    sadly unlikely to change in the future. Apple has expelled NVIDIA graphics
    (and therefore APIs like CUDA that Mitsuba depends on) from the Mac
    ecosystem some years ago. Please voice your concerns to Apple if you are
    unhappy with this state of affairs.

In case your CUDA installation is not automatically found by CMake (for instance
because the directory is not in `PATH`), you need to either set the environment variable
`CUDACXX` or the CMake cache entry `CMAKE_CUDA_COMPILER` to the full path to the
compiler. E.g.

.. code-block:: bash

    # Environment variable
    export CUDACXX=/usr/local/cuda/bin/nvcc

    # or

    # As part of the CMake process
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_CUDA_COMPILER=/usr/local/cuda/bin/nvcc

By default, Mitsuba is able to resolve the OptiX API itself, and therefore does not rely on
the ``optix.h`` header file. The ``MI_USE_OPTIX_HEADERS`` CMake flag can be used to turn off
this feature if a developer wants to experiment with parts of the OptiX API not yet exposed
to the framework.


Embree
------

Mitsuba's ``scalar`` and ``packet`` backends can optionally use Intel's Embree
library for ray tracing instead of the builtin kd-tree in Mitsuba 3. To do so,
invoke CMake with the ``-DMI_ENABLE_EMBREE=1`` parameter or use a visual CMake
tool like ``cmake-gui`` or ``ccmake`` to flip the value of this parameter.
Embree tends to be faster but lacks some features such as support for double
precision ray intersection.
