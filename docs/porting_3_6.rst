Porting to Mitsuba 3.6.0
========================

.. _dr_main: https://drjit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Mitsuba 3.6.0 contains a number of significant changes relative to the 
prior release, some breaking, that are predominantly driven by the dependence 
to the new version of `Dr.Jit 1.0.0 <dr_main_>`_.

This guide is intended to assist users of prior releases of 
Mitsuba 3 to quickly update their existing codebases to be compatible 
with Mitsuba 3.6.0 and we further highlight some key changes that are potential 
pitfalls.

This guide is by no means comprehensive and we direct users to the 
`Dr.Jit documentation <dr_main>`_ that contains several dedicated sections
on the design and core features of Dr.Jit 1.0.0 that Mitsuba users will find 
invaluable. Historically, the Dr.Jit documentation in past releases has been 
sparse so it's recommended that even more advanced users begin here.

Symbolic control flow
---------------------

.. _dr_cflow: https://drjit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cflow.html#symbolic-mode

`Symbolic loops <dr_cflow_>`_
in Mitsuba are no longer initialized by constructing a ``mitsuba.Loop`` 
instance. Instead, Dr.Jit 1.0.0 introduces the :py:func:`drjit.syntax` function 
decorator that allows users to express symbolic loops as if they were 
immediately-evaluated Python control flow. An example of a simple loop using 
``mitsuba.Loop`` previously looked like,

.. code-block:: python

  import mitsuba as mi

  var = mi.Float(32)
  rng = mi.PCG32(size=102400)

  def foo(var, rng):
    count   = mi.UInt(0)
    loop    = mi.Loop(state=lambda: (var, rng, count))

    while loop(count < 10):
      var     += rng.next_float32()
      count   += 1

    return var, rng

  var, rng = foo(var, rng)
  var += 1

and porting this to use the :py:func:`drjit.syntax` decorator is relatively 
straightforward,

.. code-block:: python

  import drjit as dr
  import mitsuba as mi

  var = mi.Float(32)
  rng = mi.PCG32(size=102400)

  @dr.syntax
  def foo(var, rng):
    count = mi.UInt(0)

    while count < 10:
      var     += rng.next_float32()
      count   += 1

    return var, rng

  var, rng = foo(var, rng)
  var += 1


Previously when using ``mitsuba.Loop``, it was necessary for the user to 
determine the loop variables required, which was bug-prone. 
:py:func:`drjit.syntax` automates this step and internally reexpresses the loop 
as a :py:func:`drjit.while_loop` call. While the Dr.Jit API reference details 
how to directly call :py:func:`drjit.while_loop`, users should prefer using 
:py:func:`drjit.syntax` when porting their existing code.

Prior to Dr.Jit 1.0.0, tracing if-statements containing JIT variables was not 
possible, and the only alternative was to replace conditionals with masked 
operations, for example using :py:func:`drjit.select`. As experience has shown, 
converting conditional code into masked form can be rather tedious and bug-prone.

Therefore, the :py:func:`dr.syntax` annotation additionally handles if-statements 
analogously to while loops, where internally such statements are reexpressed as 
:py:func:`drjit.if_stmt` calls. Masked code remains valid but it is often no 
longer needed.

.. warning::

  While changing existing codebases to leverage symbolic if-statements can 
  improve both readability and performance, it's important to highlight 
  computational differences relative to :py:func:`drjit.select`. As a 
  contrived example consider

  .. code-block:: python

    x = dr.arange(mi.Float, 5)
    y = dr.select(x < 2, 1, 2)

  which if we were to unwisely express as an if-statement

  .. code-block:: python

    # Don't do this!
    @dr.syntax 
    def bad_code(x : mi.Float):
      out : mi.Float  = mi.Float(0)
      if x < 2:
        out = mi.Float(1)
      else
        out = mi.Float(2)

      return out

    x = dr.arange(mi.Float, 5)
    y = bad_code()

  is not only more cumbersome to write but will also give you worse performance 
  relative to the :py:func:`drjit.select` call. This is because now during 
  evaluation, we have to check the condition, perform a jump to either the true 
  or false branch of the if-statement and *then* step through the branch to 
  perform the output assignment. In contrast, evaluating a 
  :py:func:`drjit.select` call involves no additonal branching.

  The real performance benefit of symbolic if-statements are when you have 
  relatively expensive operations that only need to be computed within a given 
  branch, because unlike  :py:func:`drjit.select` calls, computations for both 
  the true or false conditions do not have to be evaluated *prior* to evaluating 
  the if-statement itself. In other words, you can potentially avoid a lot of 
  expensive, branch-specific computations when the condition for evaluating a 
  particular branch is relatively rare.

Bitmap textures: Half-precision storage by default where possible
------------------------------------------------------------------

  .. _dr_texture: https://drjit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/textures.html
  .. _spec_up: https://rgl.epfl.ch/publications/Jakob2019Spectral

  Dr.Jit 1.0.0 includes support for half-precision arrays and tensors, and further
  extends support for FP16 `Dr.Jit textures <dr_texture_>`_ that are 
  hardware-accelerated on CUDA backends.

  From Mitsuba 3.6.0 onwards, bitmap textures initialized from data with bit
  depth 16 or lower will instantiate an underlying half-precision Dr.Jit texture.

  .. note::
    Using spectral Mitsuba variants is an exception to this default behavior, and 
    the underlying storage of the bitmap texture will remain consistent to the variant 
    as with previous versions of Mitsuba 3. This is because here sampling a 
    texture requires `spectral upsampling <spec_up_>`_ and RGB input data is 
    first converted to their corresponding spectral coefficients.

  There may be cases where this default behavior is undesirable. For instance, if 
  a user is performing an iterative optimization of a given bitmap texture, a 
  potential pitfall is highlighted in the following example

  .. code-block:: python

    import mitsuba as mi
    import drjit as dr
    mi.set_variant('cuda_ad_rgb')

    # Bit depth of my_image.png is less than 16 so storage of texture is FP16
    bitmap = mi.load_dict({
        "type" : "bitmap",
        "filename" : "my_image.png"
    })

    params = mi.traverse(bitmap)

    # Want to update the associated tensor but using TensorXf (single-precision)
    x = dr.ones(mi.TensorXf, shape=(9,10,3))

    # Implicit conversion from TensorXf to TensorXf16
    params['data'] = x
    params.update()

    type(params['data']) # TensorXf16 not TensorXf

  The above example is somewhat contrived because in practice, for an optimization, a 
  user would likely initialize their bitmap texture from a tensor and hence the 
  underlying storage precision would be explicitly specified. Regardless, opting
  out of this default behavior is possible by setting the plugin ``format`` 
  parameter to ``variant``

  .. code-block:: python

    import mitsuba as mi
    mi.set_variant('cuda_ad_rgb')

    # Storage precision is consistent with variant specified (i.e. float)
    bitmap = mi.load_dict({
        "type" : "bitmap",
        "filename" : "my_image.png"
        "format" : "variant"
    })

    params = mi.traverse(bitmap)
    type(params['data']) # TensorXf

C++ interface changes
---------------------

.. _dr_cpp: https://drjit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cpp.html

Mitsuba 3.6.0 has also introduced changes that affect C++ developers who have 
extended Mitsuba 3. As with the Python interface, most of these changes are 
driven by Dr.Jit 1.0.0 and we again recommend users first begin by reading 
the `Dr.Jit documentation <dr_main_>`_ and in particular the dedicated section 
on the `Dr.Jit C++ interface <dr_cpp_>`_.

Control flow
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _dr_cpp_custom_data: https://drjit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cpp.html#custom-types-cpp
.. _dr_cpp_if: https://drjit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cpp.html#vectorized-conditionals

Analogous to Dr.Jit's vectorized control flow changes in Python, in C++ 
``drjit.Loop`` has similarly been removed in Dr.Jit 1.0.0. Here, however 
there is no equivalent to the Python Dr.Jit function decorator 
:py:func:`drjit.syntax` that automatically tracks which JIT variables are used 
by the loop. Instead, users are required to call :py:func:`drjit.while_loop` 
and, as with past releases, manually specify the loop variables

.. code-block:: cpp

  Float x;
  Bool y;

  dr::tie(x, y) = dr::while_loop(dr::make_tuple(x, y), /* initial state */
    [](const Float& x, const Bool& y) { return y; },   /* condition     */
    [](Float& x, Bool& y) { ... });                    /* body          */

  x += 1;

.. note::

  Expressing a loop with a high number of tracked variables can be cumbersome
  to write out. However, Dr.Jit 1.0.0 provides the ability to locally define
  `custom traversable data types <dr_cpp_custom_data_>`_ that can be leveraged 
  to specify the entire loop state

  .. code-block:: cpp

    struct LoopState {
      Float foo;
      Float bar;
      Float more;
      Bool active;
    } = ls { x1, x2, x3, active };

    dr::tie(ls) = dr::while_loop(dr::make_tuple(ls),   /* initial state */
      [](const LoopState& ls) { return ls.active; },   /* condition     */
      [](LoopState& ls) { ... });                      /* body          */

As with the Python interface, the C++ interface similarly exposes support for 
vectorized conditionals using :py:func:`drjit.if_stmt` and we direct users to the 
`Dr.Jit documentation <dr_cpp_if_>`_ for further details and example usage.

Removal of ``dr::eq``, ``dr::neq``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Historically, the Dr.Jit functions ``drjit::eq`` and ``drjit::neq``
performed elementwise comparisons on array types

.. code-block:: cpp

  Float a, b = ... ;
  Float res = dr::eq(a, b);


while the operators ``==`` and ``!=`` would implicitly evaluate and reduce the 
result

.. code-block:: cpp

  bool res = a == b;


Dr.Jit 1.0.0 removes ``drjit::eq`` and ``drjit::neq`` which are replaced by the 
overloaded operators ``==`` and ``!=`` respectively. Any reductions now have
to be explicitly specified by using the :py:func:`drjit.all` or
:py:func:`drjit.any` functions for instance 

.. code-block:: cpp

  bool res = dr::all(a == b);


``dr::Matrix`` ordering now row-major
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In Dr.Jit 1.0.0, the internal storage of ``dr::Matrix`` types has changed from 
column to row-major ordering. While common matrix operations such as multiplication
are unaffected by this change, there is a potential pitfall for existing
codebases that read or modify the storage directly, for example

.. code-block:: cpp

  dr::Matrix<Float, 3> m = ...;

  // Returned array is now first row, not column!
  auto& v = m.entry(0);


Simplified vectorized method getters: ``dr::set_attr`` removed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _dr_vcall_get: https://drjit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cpp.html#c.DRJIT_CALL_GETTER

In past Mitsuba releases, defining custom C++ plugins with 
`vectorized getters <dr_vcall_get>`_ was bug-prone as developers would be 
required to additionally remember to call ``dr::set_attr`` during initialization

.. code-block:: cpp

  MyPlugin(const Properties &props) : Base(props) {
    ...
    m_getter = m_components[0];
    dr::set_attr(this, "getter", m_getter);
  }

which allowed Dr.Jit to perform an optimization during tracing of getters to 
avoid any actual method calls. Specifically, as getters are read-only and 
have no side-effects, tracing of such calls can be interpreted as indexing into
an array of variables that correspond to the result of each possible instance.

In Dr.Jit 1.0.0, such an optimization remains however developers
are no longer required to additionally call ``dr::set_attr``.

.. code-block:: cpp

  // Registered getter as DRJIT_CALL_GETTER
  uint32_t Base::getter() const { return m_getter; }

  MyPlugin(const Properties &props) : Base(props) {
    ...
    m_getter = m_components[0];
  }
