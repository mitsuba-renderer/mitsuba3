/**
 * \brief Intermediate storage for an image or image sub-region being rendered
 *
 * This class facilitates parallel rendering of images in both scalar and
 * JIT-based variants of Mitsuba.
 *
 * In scalar mode, image blocks represent independent rectangular image regions
 * that are simultaneously processed by worker threads. They are finally merged
 * into a master \ref ImageBlock controlled by the \ref Film instance via the
 * \ref put_block() method. The smaller image blocks can include a border
 * region storing contributions that are slightly outside of the block, which
 * is required to correctly account for image reconstruction filters.
 *
 * In JIT variants there is only a single \ref ImageBlock, whose contents are
 * computed in parallel. A border region is usually not needed in this case.
 *
 * In addition to receiving samples via the \ref put() method, the image block
 * can also be queried via the \ref read() method, in which case the
 * reconstruction filter is used to compute suitable interpolation weights.
 * This is feature is useful for differentiable rendering, where one needs to
 * evaluate the reverse-mode derivative of the \ref put() method.

    /**
     * \brief Construct a zero-initialized image block with the desired shape
     * and channel count
     *
     * \param size
     *    Specifies the desired horizontal and vertical block size. This value
     *    excludes additional border pixels that \c ImageBlock will internally
     *    add to support image reconstruction filters (if <tt>border=true</tt>
     *    and a reconstruction filter is furthermore specified)
     *
     * \param offset
     *    Specifies the offset in case this block represents sub-region of a
     *    larger image. Otherwise, this can be set to zero.
     *
     * \param channel_count
     *    Specifies the desired number of image channels.
     *
     * \param rfilter
     *    The desired reconstruction filter to be used in \ref read() and \ref
     *    put(). A box filter will be used if when <tt>rfilter==nullptr</tt>.
     *
     * \param border
     *    Should \c ImageBlock add an additional border region around around
     *    the image boundary to capture contributions to neighboring pixels
     *    caused by a nontrivial (non-box) reconstruction filter? This is
     *    mainly useful when a larger image is partitioned into smaller blocks
     *    that are rendered in parallel. Enabled by default in scalar variants.
     *
     * \param normalize
     *    This parameter affects the behavior of \ref read() and \ref put().
     *
     *    If set to \c true, each call to \ref put() explicitly normalizes the
     *    computed filter weights so that the operation adds a unit amount of
     *    energy to the image. This is useful for methods like particle tracing
     *    that invoke \ref put() with an arbitrary distribution of image
     *    positions. Other methods (e.g., path tracing) that uniformly sample
     *    positions in image space should set this parameter to \c false, since
     *    the image block contents will eventually be divided by a dedicated
     *    channel tracking the accumulated sample weight to remove any
     *    non-uniformity.
     *
     *    Furthermore, if \c normalize is set to \c true, the \ref read()
     *    operation will normalize the filter weights to compute a convex
     *    combination of pixel values.
     *
     *    Disabled by default.
     *
     * \param coalesce
     *   This parameter is only relevant for JIT variants (it is enabled by
     *   default only in LLVM mode), where it subtly affects the behavior of
     *   the performance-critical \ref put() method.
     *
     *   In coalesced mode, \ref put() conservatively bounds the footprint
     *   and traverses it in lockstep across the whole wavefront. This causes
     *   unnecessary atomic memory operations targeting pixels with a zero
     *   filter weight. At the same time, this greatly reduces thread
     *   divergence and can lead to significant speedups when \ref put()
     *   writes to pixels in a regular (e.g., scanline) order. Coalesced
     *   mode is preferable for rendering algorithms like path tracing that
     *   uniformly generate samples within pixels on the sensor.
     *
     *   In contrast, non-coalesced mode is preferable when the input positions
     *   are random and will in any case be subject to thread divergence (e.g.
     *   in a particle tracer that makes random connections to the sensor).
     *
     * \param warn_negative
     *    If set to \c true, \ref put() will warn when writing samples with
     *    negative components. This test is only enabled in scalar variants by
     *    default, since checking/error reporting is relatively costly in
     *    JIT-compiled modes.
     *
     * \param warn_invalid
     *    If set to \c true, \ref put() will warn when writing samples with
     *    NaN (not a number) or positive/negative infinity component values.
     *    This test is only enabled in scalar variants by default, since
     *    checking/error reporting is relatively costly in JIT-compiled modes.
