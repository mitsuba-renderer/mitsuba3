/**
 * \brief Abstract integrator base class, which does not make any assumptions
 * with regards to how radiance is computed.
 *
 * In Mitsuba, the different rendering techniques are collectively referred to
 * as \a integrators, since they perform integration over a high-dimensional
 * space. Each integrator represents a specific approach for solving the light
 * transport equation---usually favored in certain scenarios, but at the same
 * time affected by its own set of intrinsic limitations. Therefore, it is
 * important to carefully select an integrator based on user-specified accuracy
 * requirements and properties of the scene to be rendered.
 *
 * This is the base class of all integrators; it does not make any assumptions
 * on how radiance is computed, which allows for many different kinds of
 * implementations.

     * rendering process. In particular:
     *
     * \param seed
     *     This parameter controls the initialization of the random number
     *     generator. It is crucial that you specify different seeds (e.g., an
     *     increasing sequence) if subsequent \c render() calls should produce
     *     statistically independent images.
     *
     * \param spp
     *     Set this parameter to a nonzero value to override the number of
     *     samples per pixel. This value then takes precedence over whatever
     *     was specified in the construction of <tt>sensor->sampler()</tt>.
     *     This parameter may be useful in research applications where an image
     *     must be rendered multiple times using different quality levels.
     *
     * \param develop
     *     If set to \c true, the implementation post-processes the data stored
     *     in <tt>sensor->film()</tt>, returning the resulting image as a
     *     \ref TensorXf. Otherwise, it returns an empty tensor.
     *
     * \param evaluate
     *     This parameter is only relevant for JIT variants of Mitsuba (LLVM,
     *     CUDA). If set to \c true, the rendering step evaluates the generated
     *     image and waits for its completion. A log message also denotes the
     *     rendering time. Otherwise, the returned tensor
     *     (<tt>develop=true</tt>) or modified film (<tt>develop=false</tt>)
     *     represent the rendering task as an unevaluated computation graph.

    /**
     * \brief Evaluates the forward-mode derivative of the rendering step.
     *
     * Forward-mode differentiation propagates gradients from scene parameters
     * through the simulation, producing a *gradient image* (i.e., the derivative
     * of the rendered image with respect to those scene parameters). The gradient
     * image is very helpful for debugging, for example to inspect the gradient
     * variance or visualize the region of influence of a scene parameter. It is
     * not particularly useful for simultaneous optimization of many parameters,
     * since multiple differentiation passes are needed to obtain separate
     * derivatives for each scene parameter. See ``Integrator.render_backward()``
     * for an efficient way of obtaining all parameter derivatives at once, or
     * simply use the ``mi.render()`` abstraction that hides both
     * ``Integrator.render_forward()`` and ``Integrator.render_backward()`` behind
     * a unified interface.
     *
     * Before calling this function, you must first enable gradient tracking and
     * furthermore associate concrete input gradients with one or more scene
     * parameters, or the function will just return a zero-valued gradient image.
     * This is typically done by invoking ``dr.enable_grad()`` and
     * ``dr.set_grad()`` on elements of the ``SceneParameters`` data structure
     * that can be obtained obtained via a call to ``mi.traverse()``.
     *
     * Note the default implementation of this functionality relies on naive
     * automatic differentiation (AD), which records a computation graph of the
     * primal rendering step that is subsequently traversed to propagate
     * derivatives. This tends to be relatively inefficient due to the need to
     * track intermediate program state. In particular, it means that
     * differentiation of nontrivial scenes at high sample counts will often run
     * out of memory. Integrators like ``rb`` (Radiative Backpropagation) and
     * ``prb`` (Path Replay Backpropagation) that are specifically designed for
     * differentiation can be significantly more efficient.
     *
     * \param scene
     *    The scene to be rendered differentially.
     *
     * \param params
     *    An arbitrary container of scene parameters that should receive
     *    gradients. Typically this will be an instance of type
     *    ``mi.SceneParameters`` obtained via ``mi.traverse()``. However, it could
     *    also be a Python list/dict/object tree (DrJit will traverse it to find
     *    all parameters). Gradient tracking must be explicitly enabled for each of
     *    these parameters using ``dr.enable_grad(params['parameter_name'])`` (i.e.
     *    ``render_forward()`` will not do this for you). Furthermore,
     *    ``dr.set_grad(...)`` must be used to associate specific gradient values
     *    with each parameter.
     *
     * \param sensor
     *    Specify a sensor or a (sensor index) to render the scene from a
     *    different viewpoint. By default, the first sensor within the scene
     *    description (index 0) will take precedence.
