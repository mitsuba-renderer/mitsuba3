/**
 * \brief Central scene data structure
 *
 * Mitsuba's scene class encapsulates a tree of mitsuba \ref Object instances
 * including emitters, sensors, shapes, materials, participating media, the
 * integrator (i.e. the method used to render the image) etc.
 *
 * It organizes these objects into groups that can be accessed through getters
 * (see \ref shapes(), \ref emitters(), \ref sensors(), etc.), and it provides
 * three key abstractions implemented on top of these groups, specifically:
 *
 * <ul>
 *    <li>Ray intersection queries and shadow ray tests
 *        (See \ray_intersect_preliminary(), \ref ray_intersect(),
 *         and \ref ray_test()).</li>
 *
 *    <li>Sampling rays approximately proportional to the emission profile of
 *        light sources in the scene (see \ref sample_emitter_ray())</li>
 *
 *    <li>Sampling directions approximately proportional to the
 *        direct radiance from emitters received at a given scene location
 *        (see \ref sample_emitter_direction()).</li>
 * </ul>

     *
     * This generalized ray intersection method exposes two additional flags to
     * control the intersection process. Internally, it is split into two
     * steps:
     *
     * <ol>
     *   <li> Finding a \ref PreliminaryInteraction using the ray tracing
     *        backend underlying the current variant (i.e., Mitsuba's builtin
     *        kd-tree, Embree, or OptiX). This is done using the
     *        \ref ray_intersect_preliminary() function that is also available
     *        directly below (and preferable if a full \ref SurfaceInteraction
     *        is not needed.).
     *   </li>
     *
     *   <li> Expanding the \ref PreliminaryInteraction into a full
     *        \ref SurfaceInteraction (this part happens within Mitsuba/Dr.Jit
     *        and tracks derivative information in AD variants of the system).
     *   </li>
     * </ol>
     *
     * The \ref SurfaceInteraction data structure is large, and computing its
     * contents in the second step requires a non-trivial amount of computation
     * and sequence of memory accesses. The \c ray_flags parameter can be used
     * to specify that only a sub-set of the full intersection data structure
     * actually needs to be computed, which can improve performance.
     *
     * In the context of differentiable rendering, the \c ray_flags parameter
     * also influences how derivatives propagate between the input ray, the
     * shape parameters, and the computed intersection (see
     * \ref RayFlags::FollowShape and \ref RayFlags::DetachShape for details on
     * this). The default, \ref RayFlags::All, propagates derivatives through
     * all steps of the intersection computation.
     *
     * The \c coherent flag is a hint that can improve performance in the first
     * step of finding the \ref PreliminaryInteraction if the input set of rays
     * is coherent (e.g., when they are generated by \ref Sensor::sample_ray(),
     * which means that adjacent rays will traverse essentially the same region
     * of space). This flag is currently only used by the combination of
     * <tt>llvm_*</tt> variants and the Embree ray tracing backend.

     *    \c ray contains a coherent set of rays (e.g. primary camera rays),
     *    and when using <tt>llvm_*</tt> variants of the renderer along with
     *    Embree. It has no effect in scalar or CUDA/OptiX variants.
