/**
 * \brief Abstract interface subsuming emitters and sensors in Mitsuba.
 *
 * This class provides an abstract interface to emitters and sensors in
 * Mitsuba, which are named \a endpoints since they represent the first and
 * last vertices of a light path. Thanks to symmetries underlying the equations
 * of light transport and scattering, sensors and emitters can be treated as
 * essentially the same thing, their main difference being type of emitted
 * radiation: light sources emit \a radiance, while sensors emit a conceptual
 * radiation named \a importance. This class casts these symmetries into a
 * unified API that enables access to both types of endpoints using the same
 * set of functions.
 *
 * Subclasses of this interface must implement functions to evaluate and sample
 * the emission/response profile, and to compute probability densities
 * associated with the provided sampling techniques.
 *
 * In addition to :py:meth:`mitsuba.Endpoint.sample_ray`, which generates a
 * sample from the profile, subclasses also provide a specialized <em>direction
 * sampling</em> method in :py:meth:`mitsuba.Endpoint.sample_direction`. This is
 * a generalization of direct illumination techniques to both emitters \a and
 * sensors. A direction sampling method is given an arbitrary reference position
 * in the scene and samples a direction from the reference point towards the
 * endpoint (ideally proportional to the emission/sensitivity profile). This
 * reduces the sampling domain from 4D to 2D, which often enables the
 * construction of smarter specialized sampling techniques.
 *
 * When rendering scenes involving participating media, it is important to know
 * what medium surrounds the sensors and emitters. For this reason, every
 * endpoint instance keeps a reference to a medium (which may be set to
 * \c nullptr when the endpoint is surrounded by vacuum).
 *
 * In the context of polarized simulation, the perfect symmetry between
 * emitters and sensors technically breaks down: the former emit 4D <em>Stokes
 * vectors</em> encoding the polarization state of light, while sensors are
 * characterized by 4x4 <em>Mueller matrices</em> that transform the incident
 * polarization prior to measurement. We sidestep this non-symmetry by simply
 * using Mueller matrices everywhere: in the case of emitters, only the first
 * column will be used (the remainder being filled with zeros). This API
 * simplification comes at a small extra cost in terms of register usage and
 * arithmetic. The JIT (LLVM, CUDA) variants of Mitsuba can recognize
 * these redundancies and remove them retroactively.
