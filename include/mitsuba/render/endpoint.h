/**
 * \brief Endpoint: an abstract interface to light sources and sensors
 *
 * This class implements an abstract interface to all sensors and light sources
 * emitting radiance and importance, respectively. Subclasses implement
 * functions to evaluate and sample the profile, and to compute probability
 * densities associated with the provided sampling techniques.
 *
 * The name \a endpoint refers to the property that while a light path may
 * involve any number of scattering events, it always starts and ends with
 * emission and a measurement, respectively.
 *
 * In addition to \ref Endpoint::sample_ray, which generates a sample from the
 * profile, subclasses also provide a specialized direction sampling method.
 * This is a generalization of direct illumination techniques to both emitters
 * \a and sensors. A direction sampling method is given an arbitrary reference
 * position in the scene and samples a direction from the reference point
 * towards the endpoint (ideally proportional to the emission/sensitivity
 * profile). This reduces the sampling domain from 4D to 2D, which often
 * enables the construction of smarter specialized sampling techniques.
 *
 * When rendering scenes involving participating media, it is important to know
 * what medium surrounds the sensors and light sources. For this reason, every
 * endpoint instance keeps a reference to a medium (which may be set to \c
 * nullptr when it is surrounded by vacuum).
 *
 * For polarized rendering algorithms, the emitter and sensor sides are less
 * symmetric as they use either Stokes vector or Mueller matrix representations.
 * This is avoided here by also useing Mueller matrices for Stokes vectors where
 * only their first column is non-zero. This comes at the cost of some
 * additional arithmetic but simplifies the API.

     * \brief Importance sample a ray proportional to the endpoint's
     * sensitivity/emission profile.
     *
     * The endpoint profile is a six-dimensional quantity that depends on time,
     * wavelength, surface position, and direction. This function takes a given
     * time value and five uniformly distributed samples on the interval [0, 1]
     * and warps them so that the returned ray follows the profile. Any
     * discrepancies between ideal and actual sampled profile are absorbed into
     * a spectral importance weight that is returned along with the ray.
     *
     * \param time
     *    The scene time associated with the ray to be sampled
     *
     * \param sample1
     *     A uniformly distributed 1D value that is used to sample the spectral
     *     dimension of the emission profile.
     *
     * \param sample2
     *    A uniformly distributed sample on the domain <tt>[0,1]^2</tt>. For
     *    sensor endpoints, this argument corresponds to the sample position in
     *    fractional pixel coordinates relative to the crop window of the
     *    underlying film.
     *    This argument is ignored if <tt>needs_sample_2() == false</tt>.
     *
     * \param sample3
     *    A uniformly distributed sample on the domain <tt>[0,1]^2</tt>. For
     *    sensor endpoints, this argument determines the position on the
     *    aperture of the sensor.
     *    This argument is ignored if <tt>needs_sample_3() == false</tt>.
     *
     * \return
     *    The sampled ray and (potentially spectrally varying) importance
     *    weights. The latter account for the difference between the profile
     *    and the actual used sampling density function.
