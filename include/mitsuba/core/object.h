/**
 * \brief Object base class with builtin reference counting
 *
 * This class (in conjunction with the ``ref`` reference counter) constitutes the
 * foundation of an efficient reference-counted object hierarchy. The
 * implementation here is an alternative to standard mechanisms for reference
 * counting such as ``std::shared_ptr`` from the STL.
 *
 * Why not simply use ``std::shared_ptr``? To be spec-compliant, such shared
 * pointers must associate a special record with every instance, which stores
 * at least two counters plus a deletion function. Allocating this record
 * naturally incurs further overheads to maintain data structures within the
 * memory allocator. In addition to this, the size of an individual
 * ``shared_ptr`` references is at least two data words. All of this quickly
 * adds up and leads to significant overheads for large collections of
 * instances, hence the need for an alternative in Mitsuba.
 *
 * In contrast, the ``Object`` class allows for a highly efficient
 * implementation that only adds 64 bits to the base object (for the counter)
 * and has no overhead for references. In addition, when using Mitsuba in
 * Python, this counter is shared with Python such that the ownerhsip and
 * lifetime of any ``Object`` instance across C++ and Python is managed by it.
